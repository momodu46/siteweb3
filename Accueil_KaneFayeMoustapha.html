        <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>With warmth and respect, coach Gonzalo Vilariño tells the captivating story of the Argentine blind football team -- and how sincere belief in them and their abilities transformed the players' humble beginnings into two-time World Cup winners . “You have to go out and play all the matches in this beautiful tournament that is life,” Vilariño said.</p>
  </div>

        <h2>The Opening Anecdote</h2>
	<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>I opened the skull of a blind man. I didn't make him think or think, I literally cracked his head open. We were walking, he was holding on to my shoulder, I miscalculated the space between us and I slammed him against a gate. Five stitches on his forehead. I felt like I was the worst teacher in the world. I didn't know how to apologize. Fortunately, El Pulga is one of those people who takes everything well. He always says that I was the coach who had the biggest “impact” on his career.</p>
   </div>

		<h2>Every beginning is difficult</h2>
    <div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>In truth, when I started in an institute for the blind, many things surprised me. They did a lot of things I would have thought impossible: they swam, they did athletics, they played cards. They drank mate and poured it without burning themselves in the process. But when I saw them play football, I found it incredible. They had a dirt pitch, rusty poles and leaky nets. The blind people from the institute played there, as I played in a field near my house. But they were playing without being able to see. The balloon made a sound so they could locate it. They had a guide behind the opposing goal to know where to shoot the ball. They had masks over their eyes. Some could see a little and they wore masks to make everyone equal. Once I was more comfortable with them, I asked them for a mask. I put it on and tried to play. I had played football my whole life. It became even more extraordinary: in 2 seconds, I no longer knew where I was. I studied physical education because I loved high-level sport. It was by chance that I worked at the institute. My other job was with the Argentine national rowing team and I felt like that was my thing. There, everything was twice as hard. I will never forget the first day of warming up with the team. I lined them up facing me -- I did this with the rowing team -- and I told everyone to duck, I did that move. Two sat down, three lay down, the others crouched. How can I do here what I did there? It took me a while. I looked for tools to learn, I asked for help from the teachers working with them. I couldn't explain a match on a board like the coaches, I used a board and plastic caps so that they follow by touching. I learned they could run on a track if I ran with them and held a rope. We were looking for volunteers to run with them. I loved what I did and found purpose and meaning in what we did. At first it was difficult, uncomfortable, but I decided to get over it. There came a time when it became the most fascinating job I've had.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Lack of consideration</h2>
		<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>So I asked myself: why couldn't this be a top team? Of course, there was one thing missing: we had to find out what people wanted the real protagonists of the story. Three hours of training playing football on this field wouldn't be enough. We would have to train differently. We began to demand more, and the response was magnificent; they asked for more. I understood that they too were wondering if they could play at a high level. Once ready, we hit CENARD. CENARD is the National Center for High Level Sports of Argentina. It was difficult to make ourselves heard. But it was considerably more difficult to get other athletes to be seen as their equals. They let us use the field just when no other team was using it. We were called “the blind”. Nobody knew what we were doing there.</p>
    </div>
	
        <h2>The 2006 World Cup: The turning point</h2>
		<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>The 2006 World Cup marked a turning point in the team's history. For the first time, it took place in Buenos Aires. This was our chance to show everyone what we had been doing all this time. We were in the final. We were growing as a team. The final pitted us against Brazil. They were the best team in the tournament. All the victories had been overwhelming. Nobody believed we could win. Nobody except us. During the preparation meetings, in the locker room, during warm-ups, it smelled of victory. I swear this smell exists. I felt it several times with the team but I remember this day, the day before the final. The Argentine Football Association opened its doors to us and we trained at the AFA where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained. For us... For the first time, we felt like we were a national team.</p>
    </div>
	
        <h2>Pre-match: An emotional roller coaster</h2>
		<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>At 7:30 p.m. the day before the match, we were discussing strategy in the living room and a child knocked on the door, interrupting us. He suggested we go to church. He invited us to church. I tried to get rid of him, it wasn't the time, we would do that another day. He insisted, asked me to let him take the guys to church because that day the miracle-working pastor would be there. I was afraid to ask what miracles he was talking about, he responded nonchalantly, "Coach, let me take the team to church and I guarantee that when we get back half the team will be able to see." » Some of the guys laughed but imagine being blind and hearing that. I did not know what to say. I kept silent; the silence was awkward. I didn't want him to feel bad, he really believed what he was saying. One of the players saved me, he stood up and said confidently: "Juan" -- that was the kid's name -- "Gonza already told you it's not the time." Also, let me be clear: if we go to church and I can see when we get back, I will beat you up because I won't be able to play the game tomorrow. » Juan left laughing, resigned, and we continued our technical discussion. That night, when I went to bed, I dreamed about the next day's game, imagining what would happen, how we would play. I noticed that smell of victory I was talking about. And that's because, at that moment, I thought that if the other players had the same desire as Diego for this match, we couldn't lose. The next day was going to be wonderful. We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm and we couldn't wait to play. We left the AFA and the bus was full of flags that had been given to us. We were talking about the game and heard people honking and cheering for us. “Come on Murciélagos! It's the big day, the final challenge! » The guys asked me if people knew us, if they knew about the match. Some followed the bus to CENARD. Our arrival was wonderful. In the corridor leading from the locker rooms to the field, I walked with Silvio, who held on to my shoulder for me to guide him. Luckily, there was no gate along the way. Once on the ground, he asked me lots of questions. He didn't want to miss a single detail. He asked me to tell him what I saw, who was banging the drums. I tried to give him lots of details about what was happening. I told him the stands were full, people could no longer enter, that there were blue and red balloons all over the field, that they were opening an Argentine flag which covered the stands. Suddenly he cuts me off and says, “Do you see a San Pedro flag? » This is the town where he lives. I looked into the stands and spotted a small white flag with black paint on it: “Silvio, your family and all of San Pedro are here. "I told him that and he said, "She's my wife, tell me where she is so I can wave to her." » I turned him towards the flag and pointed his arm towards their position, he waved his arm. Twenty or thirty people stood up and gave him a standing ovation. When that happened I saw his face change, he was so emotional. It was emotional for me too; two seconds later, my throat was tight. It was weird -- I felt the excitement of what was happening and the anger and anxiety that he couldn't see it all. A few days later, when I told him how I felt, he tried to reassure me, said: “Gonza, don’t feel bad, I saw them. Differently, but I promise you I saw them. »</p>

        <h2>The Blind people who become national icons</h2>
		<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>The match has started. We couldn't fail, it was the final. The crowd was silent because in football for the blind, the players have to hear the ball. They can only applaud at the end of the match. Eight minutes before the end, the crowd shouted encouragement to make up for the previous 32 minutes. When Silvio, who has deformed feet, sent the ball to an angle, they put all their hearts into cheering for him, it was incredible. Today, when you go to CENARD, you will make a giant poster on the door with a photo of our team, Los Murciélagos. It's a model national team, everyone knows them at CENARD and, after winning two World Cups and two Paralympic medals, they are, without a doubt, high-level athletes. I had the chance to coach this team for 10 years, first as a coach then as a coach. I feel like they gave me so much more than I gave them.</p>
    </div>
	
        <h2>The moral of the story</h2>
		<div class="scrollable-div">
        <p>Last year they asked me to coach another national team, Power Soccer. It is a national team of young men playing wheelchair football. Their wheelchairs are motorized and guided by joystick because they do not have enough arm strength for traditional wheelchairs. They added a bumper which is used to protect their feet and kick the ball. This is the first time that they stop being spectators and become actors. It's the first time their parents, friends and siblings have seen them play. For me it is a new challenge, with the same discomfort, doubts and fear that I had when I started with the blind. But I approach this with more experience. That's why, from the beginning, I treat them like athletes on and off the field, I try to put myself in their place and not have any prejudices because they prefer to be treated naturally. The two teams are playing football, this seemed unthinkable to them before. To do this, they had to adapt the rules. Both teams violated the same rule -- the one that said they couldn't play football. Watching them play, you see a competition, not a handicap. The problem starts at the end of the match, when they leave the field. When they play our game, in a society whose rules do not take them into account, they do not pay attention. From sports, I learned that disabilities are highly dependent on the rules of the game. I believe that if we change a few rules of our game, we can make their lives easier. We all know that there are disabled people - we see them every day - but by not having any contact with them we are not aware of their daily problems, how difficult it is to take the bus, to find a job, take the metro or cross the street. It is true that there is awareness regarding the inclusion of people with disabilities. But I think it's not enough. I think everyone needs to change. First, by leaving behind our indifference towards the disabled and then respecting the rules which take them into account. There are few but they exist. I opened the head of a blind man -- the head of El Pulga. I can assure you that these two teams have indeed opened my mind. Above all, they taught me that you have to go out and play all the matches in this beautiful tournament that is life.</p>
